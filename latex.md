# Setting up and locally using LaTeX



## Set up 

You can find most of the set up instructions for latex in `vs-code.md` 

Here I will include anything that is general latex or non-specific for latex local set up. 

 ## Writing a thesis with LaTeX

 I will add my template to the repo, when I get around to it 


 ## Writing scientific papers with LaTeX

 I will include a general template later when I get around to it. 

 Here I will also document how some things work and how I sue them. 

 ### Adding an appendix 

 ## Making Posters with Latex 

Template to come
