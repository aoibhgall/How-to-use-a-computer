# How to use a computer 

These are all the things I've learned about computers over the years working as a scientist. This repo is mostly for myself to be able to refer back to when something inevitably goes wrong. I've decided to make this public, in case anyone else might find this useful. 

I owe a great deal of thanks to some friends and coworkers who taught me a lot of this stuff. Along with online communities and source documentation. 

Ideally I would've set this repo when I got my last laptop and set everything up from scratch, but I didn't, so somethings are already set up and I don't remember the instructions. This is why I'm creating this repo. So when I set this all up again on my next machine, I will include the instructions needed, but for now some set up will have to be assumed. 

This repo might be organised quite haphazardly, I'm just adding things as porblems arise.
